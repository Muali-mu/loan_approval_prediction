## ⚙️ Steps Overview
1. Import libraries  
2. Load dataset  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Handle missing values  
5. Encode categorical features  
6. Split dataset into train/test  
7. Handle imbalanced data using **SMOTE**  
8. Train models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)  
9. Evaluate performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
10. Compare and conclude
